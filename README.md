Various tutorial-following source files

The titles of the source files keep a trend, and I plan to keep it that way. The names of the compiled files vary a bit more for (in my opinion) reasonable reasons, from `learningcpp` to `learningc` to `learningkot.jar`.

### learning.cpp
The first file in this set, and the first to follow the naming trend. It is basically finished. I completed the tutorial I was following. I may edit it more when I find something I feel is good to have in my consolidated "everything I absolutely need to know" file.

### learning.kt
The second file in the set, I am following the tutorial on-and-off. It's far from done at all.

### learning.c
The third file in the set. This file is specifically *not* a full tutorial-following. It simply has all the differences I need to know from C++, because I may be convinced to switch.

### The tutorial
All of these are from the tutorials on [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com). A lot of people don't like this site, but my brain finds it a lot easier to just read what the syntax *is* and then mess around with it on my own, rather than doing a bunch of exercises. You can come up with your own opinion about it.
