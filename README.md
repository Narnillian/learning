Various source files used to either learn or teach a language

The titles of the source files keep a trend, and I plan to keep it that way. The names of the compiled files vary a bit more for (in my opinion) reasonable reasons, from `learningcpp` to `learningc` to `learningkot.jar`.

### learning.cpp
The first file in this set, and the first to follow the naming trend. It is basically finished. I completed the tutorial I was following. I may edit it more when I find something I feel is good to have in my consolidated "everything I absolutely need to know" file.

### learning.kt
The second file in the set, I am following the tutorial on-and-off. It's far from done at all.

### learning.c
The third file in the set. This file is specifically *not* a full tutorial-following. It simply has all the differences I need to know from C++, because I may be convinced to switch.

### teaching.java
I created this to teach super-basic Java skills to the [Team 6000](https://github.com/Team6000) newbies. We were already late into the season and needed to jump-start some programming, so I threw down the basic skills we'd need and then dove into WPILib and specifically our REEFSCAPE code.

### The tutorial
All `learning.*` files from the tutorials on [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com). Some people may not like this site, but my brain finds it a lot easier to just read what the syntax *is* and then mess around with it on my own, rather than doing a bunch of exercises. It's unfortunately gotten really bloated with ads though.
